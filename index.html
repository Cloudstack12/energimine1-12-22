                                    The easiest way to understand what commodities are is to understand that they are products that are used to create other goods. In other words, they are raw materials. This can include agricultural products, metals, and fossil fuels that are natural resources that companies and people utilize in their everyday life. 
                                </p>

                                        Commodities are physical goods that are traded and sold in markets separate from the stocks and bonds that you may already have in your portfolio. Though there is a long list of different types of commodities, we have grouped them into three categories thanks to the team of experienced <a href="https://energimine.com/links/insider-newsletter/">investment management consultants</a> at Capitalist Exploits:

Typically this is done in futures contracts, but there are many other ways that you can invest in commodities, and we’re going to take a look at a few of those next.

                                        The most popular way to trade commodities is to work with futures contracts. This is a contract you buy and sell that is basically an agreement between you and another investor that is solely created on the future commodity price of that particular asset is predicted to be.

                                        With this type of purchase, you will need to set up a brokerage account that is designed for this type of trading. Along with this, there will be extra fees that you will have to pay to the Futures Trading Commission whenever you open or close a transaction.

                                        Much like opening up a store where you have no physical inventory but selling things online through a wholesaler, futures contracts mean you never have a physical commodity to take care of. There are some that choose to invest in physical commodities, particularly precious metals like gold or even jewelry. By being able to touch and feel, you get a better understanding of how much that commodity is worth.

                                        Another route you can take is to purchase commodities from a company that deals in them. This would be something like purchasing stocks for an oil company or drilling company. Of course, these investments will follow the markets that you would utilize when you purchase commodities future, but there are fewer risks as you are not specifically tied to the commodity.

                                        When choosing this option, you need to research the company itself to make sure that it is a reliable company and has a good internal structure when it comes to its management.
